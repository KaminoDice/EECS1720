## b) Project Description:

This is a UNO game made with MVC design pattern.
Now this project has completed the implementation of the following features.

1. User registration and login
2. Human players play a 1v1 UNO game
3. Pop-up help screen to introduce the rules of the game

After running the main program, you can choose to register a new user via the Sign Up button (this will be stored in user.txt in the root directory); or you can select a user from user.txt to login.

After successful login, clicking the Help button will bring up a window explaining the rules of the game, and clicking the Start button will jump to the game mode selection screen. Since no AI logic can be written, you can only choose to play a human 1v1 UNO game.

After entering the game, the game will be played according to the standard UNO rules, with the logged-in player at the bottom and the enemy player at the top. Based on the turn information displayed in the center of the battlefield, players can draw cards, play cards, choose colors, and Say UNO.

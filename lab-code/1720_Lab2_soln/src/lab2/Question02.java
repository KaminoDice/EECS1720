/**
 * <p><pre>
 * This app  prompts the user for a time. If the input adheres to the
 * input requirements (below), then the app prints to the console the number of minutes
 * that passed since the start of that day or otherwise the specified feedback
 * message. Otherwise, this app crashes or has possibly incorrect behaviours.
 * 
 * The start of the Xth day is defined as midnight of the (X-1)th day. For
 * instance, the start of the day Tuesday Jan 2nd, 2023 is defined as the
 * midnight of Monday Jan 1st (12:00am). 
 * 
 * See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock
 * 
 * The smallest value is 12:00, for which 0 minutes have elapsed since the start
 * of the day (i.e., 0 hours * 60 minutes + 0 minutes = 0 + 0 = 0). The largest
 * value is 11:59, for which 719 minutes have elapsed since the start of the day
 * (i.e., 11 hours * 60 minutes + 59 minutes = 660 + 59 = 719).
 * 
 * *** Required User Input ***
 * 
 * (1) an input that *ideally* contains two colon-delimited tokens (e.g., h:m).
 * Let the tokens be denoted h and m, respectively. But possibly not. If the
 * colon is present, then the colon may be prefixed or suffixed with an
 * arbitrary number of space characters.
 * 
 * (2) if the colon-delimiter is present, then each of the two tokens can be
 * parsed as an int.
 * 
 * (3) The first token, h, has a value 0 < h <=12. The second token, m, has a
 * value 0 <= m <= 59.
 * 
 * 
 * *** App Behaviour: ***
 * 
 * If the user's input does not contain a colon-delimiter, then the app does a
 * clean exit, with the message "Missing Colon!".
 * 
 * If the user's input does contain a colon-delimiter, and adheres to
 * requirements (2) and (3), then this app prints a value as described above.
 * Otherwise, there are no guarantees about this app's behaviour. It may crash,
 * or it may output a number that is correct or incorrect.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * *** Sample 1: ***
 * 
 * Input: 11:50
 * 
 * Output: 710
 * 
 * e.g., 11 * 60 + 50 = 710
 * 
 * *** Sample 2: ***
 * 
 * Input: 12:10  (or 0:10)
 * 
 * Output: 10
 * 
 * e.g., 0 * 60 + 10 = 10 (because 12:00 am is the start of the day, see above
 * for further explanation)
 * 
 * *** Sample 3: ***
 * 
 * Input: 56
 * 
 * Output: Missing Colon!
 * 
 * *** Sample 4: ***
 * 
 * Input: "" (i.e., the empty string)
 * 
 * Output: Missing Colon!
 * 
 * *** Sample 5: ***
 * 
 * Input: asd:asd
 * 
 * Output: unspecified (app may or may not crash)
 * 
 * *** Sample 6: ***
 * 
 * Input: 14:20
 * 
 * Output: unspecified (app may or may not crash, may produce some number,
 * perhaps 140, whereas the actual number of minutes elapsed since the start of
 * the day is 14*60+20=860)
 * 
 * *** End of Samples ***

		 * Step 1: Cut and paste your solution (the contents of elapsedMins1()
		 * from Question01 here (reduce/eliminate the comments as appropriate).
		 */
		
		/*
		 * Step 2: Read the blue comment block above (or lab API link for Question02). 
		 * You will see that we now need to implement additional behaviours for the app. 
		 * The program's behaviour now is conditional upon adherence to requirement (1).
		 * 
		 * As discussed in lectures, we can accomplish this sort of error
		 * checking either via validation (checking to test if input is as expected) 
		 * or via exception-based programming, depending on a variety of factors. 
		 * 
		 * We will use exception-based programming now, for the sake of practice, and we
		 * will discuss the pros and cons of each approach in later lectures.
		 * 
		 * To start, run the app (which is still the solution for Question01) and
		 * examine the output for the following cases (by running this file and 
		 * entering input via keyboard):
		 * 
		 * 		- no user input (just hit enter without typing anything, 
		 * 		  i.e., the input is the empty string)
		 * 
		 * 		- non-empty user input that does not contain even a single colon
		 * 		  (e.g., a sequence of only numbers)
		 * 
		 * When you type in these types of inputs, what sort of exception is
		 * raised? 
		 * 		- Make note of the exception raised 
		 * 		- Locate the statement that is causing the exception to be thrown (see stack trace)
		 */
		
		/*
		 * Step 3: Surround the statement identified in step 2 above with a
		 * try-catch block. Be very "stingy" - i.e. put *only* the statement that
		 * raises the exception in the try block. Position the try-catch block
		 * right in the middle of the list of statements. Leave all of the
		 * preceding statements outside the try-catch, before the try-catch.
		 * Leave all of the successive statements outside the try-catch, after
		 * the try-catch.
		 * 
		 * For the catch block, we want to handle the type of exception that was
		 * raised in Step 2 above.
		 * 
		 * In the catch block, specify the behaviour that, if such an exception
		 * is caught, the following message should be printed to the console
		 * "Missing colon!" and then return that message as a String from the method
		 * (this effectively exits the method)
		 */

		/*
		 * Hint: when you declare a variable outside a try block but then assign
		 * its value inside a try block, the compiler will issue an error to
		 * mitigate against the risk that the variable will not get initialized.
		 * You can eliminate this error by initializing the variable with the
		 * empty string prior to the try block.
		 */

		/*
		 * Step 4: Now we will experiment.
		 * 
		 * Step 4a: Change the catch block to catch a RuntimeException instead.
		 * Does the app still adhere to the specification?
		 * 
		 * Step 4b: Now modify the catch block to catch a NumberFormatException
		 * exception instead. Does the app still adhere to the specification?
		 * 
		 * The point of steps 4a and 4b is to elaborate our understanding of how
		 * the catch block functions. You should be able to articulate an
		 * explanation for what you observed. (If not, ask and find out before
		 * moving on to other course material). Write the explanation below in
		 * comment blocks.
		 * 
		 * Change the catch block back to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

/**
 * <p><pre>
 * This app prompts the user for a time. If the input adheres the
 * input requirements, then the app prints to the console the number of minutes
 * that passed since the start of that day. Otherwise, this app crashes or has
 * possibly incorrect behaviours.
 * 
 * The start of the Xth day is defined as midnight of the (X-1)th day. For
 * instance, the start of the day Tuesday Jan 2nd, 2023 is defined as the
 * midnight of Monday Jan 1st (12:00am). 
 * 
 * See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock
 * 
 * The smallest value is 12:00, for which 0 minutes have elapsed since the start
 * of the day (i.e., 0 hours * 60 minutes + 0 minutes = 0 + 0 = 0). The largest
 * value is 11:59, for which 719 minutes have elapsed since the start of the day
 * (i.e., 11 hours * 60 minutes + 59 minutes = 660 + 59 = 719).
 * 
 * *** Required User Input ***
 * 
 * (1) two colon-delimited tokens (e.g., h:m). Let the tokens be denoted h and
 * m, respectively. The colon may be prefixed or suffixed with an arbitrary
 * number of space characters.
 * 
 * (2) each of the two tokens can be parsed as an int
 * 
 * (3) The first token, h, has a value 0 < h <=12. The second token, m, has a
 * value 0 <= m <= 59.
 * 
 * *** App Behaviour: ***
 * 
 * If the user's input conforms to the requirements, then the app prints a value
 * as described above. Otherwise, there are no guarantees about this app's
 * behaviour. It may crash, or it may output a number that is correct or
 * incorrect.
 * 
 * *** Sample 1: ***
 * 
 * Input: 11:50
 * 
 * Output: 710
 * 
 * e.g., 11 * 60 + 50 = 710
 * 
 * *** Sample 2: ***
 * 
 * Input: 12:10  (or 0:10)
 * 
 * Output: 10
 * 
 * e.g., 0 * 60 + 10 = 10 (because 12:00 am is the start of the day, see above
 * for further explanation)
 * 
 * *** Sample 3: ***
 * 
 * Input: 56
 * 
 * Output: unspecified (app may or may not crash)
 * 
 * *** Sample 4: ***
 * 
 * Input: "" (i.e., the empty string)
 * 
 * Output: unspecified (app may or may not crash)
 * 
 * *** Sample 5: ***
 * 
 * Input: asd:asd
 * 
 * Output: unspecified (app may or may not crash)
 * 
 * *** Sample 6: ***
 * 
 * Input: 14:20
 * 
 * Output: unspecified (app may or may not crash, may produce some number,
 * perhaps 140, whereas the actual number of minutes elapsed since the start of
 * the day is 14*60+20=860)
 * 
 * *** End of Samples ***

		 * The variables for input/output are already setup for you as class fields,

		 * 	-	PROMPT the user to type the time as input via the keyboard

		 * 	-	pass this String to elapsedTime1() method 
		 *  -	print out the result returned from the elapsedTime1() method
		 *  
		 *  -   Now, you need to (expand) and COMPLETE the method elapsedTime1() above,

		 *  	as per the detailed instructions at the top of this class above
		 *  
		 *  	(you can also look at the lab API link for this lab to read a nicely 
		 *  	formatted version of the specifications for each question)
		 * 
		 * Note: 
		 * 		You may run this file directly to prompt and check what your method outputs 
		 * 		for specific typed inputs, OR you can run "TestQuestions.java" to confirm that 
		 * 		your elapsedTime1() method is passing some common test inputs.  
		 * 
		 * 		when working properly, TestQuestions.java should pass all tests for (testQ1_*) 
		 * 		-> remember to click into the TestQuestions.java file and run it to see the 
		 *         test results in the JUnit pane
		 *          
		 * 		You will use a combination of both (tester & running this file) to explore how

		 * 		of the previous question, but asks you to handle something extra - so make sure
		 * 		Question01.java works first, and copy and paste the internals of your
		 * 		Question01.elapsedMins1() method into Question02.elapsedMins2() before modifying
		 * 		it to address the additional requirements of Question02 (and so on)
